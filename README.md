## üé® Scene Configuration

The default scene includes:

- **Ground Sphere**: Large yellow Lambertian sphere serving as the ground
- **Random Spheres**: 400+ randomly positioned spheres with varied materials:
  - 80% Lambertian (diffuse) materials with random colors
  - 15% Metallic materials with random colors and fuzziness
  - 5% Dielectric (glass) materials
- **Three Main Spheres**:

  - Right: Metallic sphere with slight fuzziness

### Customizing the Scene

Modify `src/main.cpp` to experiment with:

```cpp
// Camera parameters
cam.aspect_ratio = 16.0 / 9.0;    // Image aspect ratio
cam.image_width = 1200;            // Resolution (higher = slower)
cam.samples_per_pixel = 100;       // Anti-aliasing quality
cam.max_depth = 50;               // Reflection depth
cam.vfov = 30;                    // Field of view (degrees)

// Camera positioning
cam.lookfrom = point3(13, 2, 3);  // Camera position
cam.lookat = point3(0, 0, 0);     // Look target
cam.vup = vec3(0, 1, 0);          // Up direction

// Defocus blur
cam.defocus_angle = 0.6;          // Blur amount
cam.focus_dist = 10.0;            // Focus distance
```

## üî¨ Technical Implementation Details

### Ray Tracing Pipeline

1. **Ray Generation**: Camera generates rays through each pixel with random sampling
2. **Intersection Testing**: Rays are tested against all objects using efficient algorithms
3. **Material Scattering**: Hit points scatter rays according to material properties
4. **Recursive Tracing**: Scattered rays continue until maximum depth or miss
5. **Color Accumulation**: Colors are accumulated and averaged across samples
6. **Gamma Correction**: Linear colors are converted to sRGB for display

### Performance Characteristics

- **Rendering Time**: Scales with `image_width¬≤ √ó samples_per_pixel √ó max_depth`
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal - uses shared pointers for efficient memory management
- **Quality vs Speed**: Higher samples and depth improve quality but increase render time

### Mathematical Accuracy

- **Ray-Sphere Intersection**: Uses optimized quadratic formula with numerical stability
- **Refraction**: Implements Snell's law with proper handling of total internal reflection
- **Reflection**: Uses law of reflection with optional surface roughness
- **Random Sampling**: Mersenne Twister generator for high-quality random numbers
